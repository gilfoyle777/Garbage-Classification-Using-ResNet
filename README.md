Garbage-Classification-Using-ResNet

#Problem: The main issue with the garbage wastage is an improper classification which leads to a mix up of other waste which will lead to other pollution.

#Solution: To solve this issue in a better way we are going to work on this data set which will help us get a better view of the scenario.


Basic prerequisite: High School Math, Python, and Pytorch


We are going to classify garbage based on six different classes using ResNet50 to do the work.
